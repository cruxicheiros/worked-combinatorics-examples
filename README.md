# Worked examples - Combinatorics and Graph Theory by David Guichard

In this repository, I'm working through the exercises in the textbook [Combinatorics and Graph Theory](https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/cgt_online/book/) by David Guichard of Whitman College. The textbook is licensed under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0.

I am replicating sections of the textbook, so the answers published here are similarly licensed as Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0. But you should really think twice before copying any of my work. I'm just learning this for my own interest and so if you copy my reasoning you're also potentially copying uncaught mistakes. So you're probably best off not copying anything out of this repository even if you do credit me. I would suggest looking at the textbook and working through the answer yourself.
